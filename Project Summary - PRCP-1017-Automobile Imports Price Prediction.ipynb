    "Determining the price of a car is a challenging task, due to the many factors that drive a vehicleâ€™s price on the market. The focus of this project is to develope machine learning models that can accurately predict the price of a car based on its features. Mainly, there are two project objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To find the variables which are significant in predicting the car price\n",
    "- To find most relevant machine learning model which predicts best car price for given dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The input file is given as an excel csv file which contains 201 records of different cars information and 26 total features which are very well defined. The shape of the data is (201 X 26). These 26 features are classified as 16 numerical and 10 categorical data. The dataset has total 51 missing values which are denoted as \"?\". Based on the Normality tests of numerical variables with missing values, it has been decided to replace all numerical missing values with Median values of that perticular column. Categorical missing values are replaced with Mode value of that column.\n",

    "The Machine Learning Regressor Models are used to find the R2-score & Mean_absolute_error of the data. Two types of datasets have been used : One dataset consists of All Outliers of Predictor and Target Variables where as in second dataset Outliers of Target variables are dropped.

It uses a model called decision tree, specifically as the name suggests, multiple decision trees to generate the ensemble model which collectively produces a prediction. The benefit of this model is that the trees are produced in parallel and are relatively uncorrelated, thus producing good results as each tree is not prone to individual errors of other trees. \n",
